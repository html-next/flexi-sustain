<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>
  Flexi is a layout framework built to solve difficult maintainability and performance concerns
  on projects with responsive designs or that ship layouts for more than one screen size.
</p>

<p>
  Flexi will help you build faster, smarter, with an eye on long term needs and goal, and it
  integrates well with existing Ember projects of any size.
</p>

<p>
  Best yet, Flexi is not a huge library that clogs up your app's runtime. Instead, it focuses
  on giving you declarative layout features that are processed at build time, leaving the most
  minimal runtime footprint possible and without bloating the size of your app.
</p>

<p>
  Flexi is not a ui framework.  It is a small set of layout primitives that make it simple
  to design for a range of device sizes and platforms, and it can easily integrate with your
  existing ui-framework and/or grid-system of choice.
