    <h1>Sustain</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      Use the sustain helper to explicitly declare component instances that can be recycled.
      This lets Ember recycle a component instance and it's associated DOM across layout and
      route boundaries.
    </p>

    <p>
      A sustain is essentially a "marker" for where a particular component instance should be inserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the component a sustain specifies is moved from marker to marker, only one marker instance
      for a given component name can be used at a time (Coming Soon: 1.1 will allow multiple named instances).
    </p>
    <p>
      This produces a significant performance advantage by allowing you to seamlessly restructure your
      app's DOM when shifting from one layout or route to another without needing to teardown and rebuild DOM.

    <h3>Providing a model for your component</h3>

    <h4>Complex Models</h4>
    <p>
      Use the hash helper to handle more complex model situations.
    </p>
    {{code-snippet name='sustain-3.hbs'}}

    <h3>Dealing with animation and other scenarios in which two instances exist at once.</h3>
    <p>
      Only one instance of the sustainable is alive and rendered at a time, but if you are animating
      from one location to another you can choose to leave behind a copy.
    </p>
    {{code-snippet name='sustain-4.hbs'}}

    <h3>Configuring the component's cache expire time.</h3>
    <p>
      By default, a sustain is destroyed when it has gone unused for 15 seconds.
      You can alter this expiration. A value of 0 or -1 will cause the sustain to
      live forever.
